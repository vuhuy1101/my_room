			<h1>International Burger</h1>
			<p>I designed a simple burger website which can display either German or English depending on where the users access the website using 'gettext'. Users also have an option to switch between two languages. I also create 2 databases: one for admin, and one for patrons. Suppose that the owner of the restaurant uses this website and he is using gift cards for his business, he can log in as administrator to keep track of patrons' gift card balance.</p>
