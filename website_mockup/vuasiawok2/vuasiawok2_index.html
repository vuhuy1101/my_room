			<h1>VU ASIA WOK v2</h1>
			<p>I made another version for Vu Asia Wok website. The client wants to be able to see the restaurant info (such as hours, address ... ) right away when he enters the website. Also, everything needs to be easy to navigate but unique as well, so I come up with the idea of having everything accessible within a computer screen. I used Javascript and jQuery for dynamically loading contents</p>
