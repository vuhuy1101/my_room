			<h1>FUTURERA</h1>
			<p>I and my teamm built the website Futurera as a final project for one of my CS classes. Futurera is a MOOC aggregator website that collects course information from multiple Massive Open Online Courses including: Coursera, Udacity, EdX, Canvas, Iversity, and FutureLearn. My work involves scraping courses from Coursera and building the front end of the website, including homepage UI, logo, fonts. Coursera offers over 1700+ courses, and 1630 of them was scrapped using Jsoup library, Java. </p>
